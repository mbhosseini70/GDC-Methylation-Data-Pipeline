\section*{Comprehensive DNA Methylation Data Processing for All TCGA Cancer Projects}

\subsection*{Description}
The script facilitates seamless data extraction and preparation from the TCGA. The functionalities included are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Library installation
    \item Data querying based on user-specified project details
    \item Random sample selection
    \item Data download and conversion
    \item Label assignment
    \item Data combination and transposition
    \item CSV output generation
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Dependencies}
Ensure R is installed with the subsequent packages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item BiocManager
    \item TCGAbiolinks
    \item tidyverse
    \item SummarizedExperiment
    \item sesameData
    \item sesame
\end{itemize}
The script will handle the installation of these packages if not already present.

\subsection*{Output}
The script will generate a processed data file named \texttt{data.csv} in the current directory. This CSV will present the methylation data, with samples as rows and features as columns. An added "Type" column indicates the specific cancer type based on TCGA nomenclature.
